Design an algorithm to sort an array whose first n-sqrt(n) elements are already sorted. What is the complexity of the algorithm.

I think the intent here is that, we have 2 methods. 

- Sort the rightmost half and merge (in place). Complexity = n + sqrt(n)log(n) 
- Use the insertion sort way . Complexity = n*sqrt(n) 

So, 1st method is better than 2nd.
