/*
Given set of job schedules with start and end time, write a function that returns indexes of overlapping sets. 

for ex :- 
input -> [1,2][5,6][1,5][7,8][1,6] 
return -> [0,1,2,4]
*/
I think we need to take into consideration both the starting time and the larger value of execution time for a given start time.
eg : - let us take all the jobs started at time 1

[1,2][1,5][1,6] 
the largest time for which any job starting at 1 executed = 5
at this point we have to consider all the jobs whose starting time lies between 1 to 5
i.e any job that starts at 2, 3, 4 ,5, 6 also overlaps.
