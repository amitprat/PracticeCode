given two arrays of integers of sizes m and n respectively, find the distinct elements in the two arrays in less than O(mlogm + nlogn + m+n)


Try using hash tables.
Try sorting one array and binary searching over it.

Runtime you posted in question suggests we have to beat the idea of sorting both arrays.
