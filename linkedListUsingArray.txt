using double array, one containing the value other containing the index of the next element.

In that case too, cost of inserting/deleting an element will be linear in worst case time. Or am I missing something here?

Consider arr[][3] as a linkedlist where arr[i][1] stores the data, arr[i][0] stores the previous index, and arr[i][2] stores the next index. Adding an element is trivial. To delete an element, modify the next index of the prev element and prev index of the next element. To prevent possible "holes" in the array on multiple deletions, maintain a "free list" that you can use to add an element to the deleted index instead of using a new slot altogether.
