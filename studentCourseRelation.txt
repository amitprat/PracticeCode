/*
You are given two objects, Student and Course, and there exist a many to many relation between them. 
One student can be enrolled for more than one course and there can be many students enrolled for a single course. 
Design an effective data structure to store such data keeping in mind that the time complexity for search should be optimum. 
A search can be for the list of students enrolled for a single course, or for the list of courses a single student is enrolled.

1 ) 
  unordered_map< string, list<string> > studentToCourse, courseToStudents;
2 )
  create graph with node at student name  and course name;
  
  the map data structure is to map ( string --> integer ) values in increasing order, unique values
