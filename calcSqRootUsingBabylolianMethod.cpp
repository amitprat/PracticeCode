/*
Babylonian method for square root
Algorithm:
This method can be derived from (but predates) Newtonâ€“Raphson method.


1 Start with an arbitrary positive start value x (the closer to the 
   root, the better).
2 Initialize y = 1.
3. Do following until desired approximation is achieved.
  a) Get the next approximation for root using average of x and y
  b) Set y = n/x

  float y =1;
  
  while( (x-y) > e ) {
    x = (x+y)/2;
    y = n/x;
  }
  return x;
}

/*This method can only work if N is perfect square */
