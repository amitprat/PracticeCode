Please keep in mind that you can only use each element in the array once when generating a certain x (1<=x<=N). 
Return the count of the least adding numbers. 

For example: 

N=6, arr = [1, 3] 

1 is already in arr. 

add 2 to the arr. 

3 is already in arr 

4 = 1 + 3 

5 = 2 + 3 

6 = 1 + 2 + 3 

So we return 1 since we only need to add one element which is 2. 

Can anyone give some hints?


Minimum floor(Log(N))+1 elements will be needed to make all 1 to N numbers using ADD operation.

2^0 = 1 (if N<=1 then required number of elements is 0+1 = 1)
2^1 = 2 (if N>=2 & N<=3 then required number of elements is 1+1 = 2)
2^2 = 4 (if N>=4 & N<=7 then required number of elements is 2+1 = 3)
2^3 = 8 (if N>=8 & N<=15 then required number of elements is 3+1 = 4)
2^4 = 16 (if N>=16 & N<=31 then required number of elements is 3+1 = 4)

This only tells about the minimum number of unique elements required to generate numbers in given range but not
exactly what numbers to add.
Logic is - 
with given number 1,2 and 4, we can generate only upto 7, so for generate more than 7, we need 8. Similar, for other cases too.
If we want what numbers to add, then probably we may need more regorious solution with subset sum finding mechanism.
